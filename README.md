Usually, spiders must disguise themselves with plenty of User-Agents, for some
servers are smart. The gem `useragents` can give you that!

It has frequently-used browsers such as `Chrome`, `Firefox`, `Internet Explorer`, `Safari`,
 `Opera` and so on, with frequently-used versions.

The usage is simple, just install the gem at first, then `require 'useragents`,
and at last, `UserAgents.rand()` works for you!

Enjoy it!

## Usage

``` sh
gem install useragents
```

```ruby
require 'useragents'

# Generate a random useragent for you
UserAgents.rand()
# => ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/28.0.1464.0 Safari/537.36"
```
